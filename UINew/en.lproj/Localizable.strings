The focused policy of the archbishop was subordinate to the task of exalting Novgorod the Great, renowned for its local relics and saints, and also the glorification of the St. Sophia cathedral. Founded under Archbishop Joachim, it underwent a path of development of many centuries. Until 11t56 the archbishops were appointed from Kiev, were independent from the metropolitan and were responsible for bishopric matters. After Bishop Arkady was elected to the cathedral at a veche assembly in 1156 and until the end of Novgorod’s independence in 1478, they were elected from the local clergy and received the instructions of the metropolitan. The cathedra was gradually freed from the dictate of the metropolitan, increased its land domain and turned into an important state institution. By the time of the rule of Euthymius II it was at the height of its power: the archbishops controlled the politics of Novgorod, were in charge of its treasury and presided in the Council of lords. In 1439 Archbishop Euthymius II, who installed a monument for the saints and princes buried in the St. Sophia Cathedral, significantly increased the old pantheon of local saints. A special place was held by the sanctifiers Nikita, Arkady and Moses – reverence for them was established soon after their decease. The common Russian celebration of saints, including Euthymius II himself, was confirmed at the councils of 1547 and 1549. Evidently, soon early images of the glorified archbishops were created, including the paired images of Sts. Nikita and John, which became symbols of the bishopric.";

According to the chronicles, by their “order” and “attainment”, the monasteries were founded and decorated, churches were built and decorated, icons were made and church utensils. The constant patronage of the archbishop was carried out of the St. Sophia Cathedral and Lord’s court. The diverse activity of the rules found a reflection in the diverse monuments of history and culture, above all in the chronicles, in the bark documents, in the lives’ of saints, also showing the enormous influence and high moral authority. It is noteworthy that the great Novgorod archbishops had the honor of receiving awards and privileges from the patriarch. In 1335, Archbishop Basil was given the right to carry a white hood, and in 1346 crossed robes (a phelonium decorated with crosses). In 1354, Archbishop Moses was also given the honor to serve in crossed robes, which he was brought by ambassadors sent to Constantinople to the patriarch with a complaint about “force” from the Moscow Archbishop.

But archaeological excavations show that a fortified settlement, Gorodische, appeared on the hill two hundred years earlier, in the second half of the 9th century. It is here where the first military–administrative and political center of the vast territory of Priilmenye inhabited by Finno–Ugric and Slavic tribes appeared at the turn of the 9th –10th centuries with the active participation of the newly come Scandinavians, \"Varangians.\" One reason for the place getting the status of the residence of ancient princes was the favorable geographical position of Gorodische at the crossroads of the most important trade waterways connecting the countries of the Baltic region and Russia with Byzantium and the Arab Caliphate: \"the Baltic–Volga\" and the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks.\nIt was only at the beginning of the 19th century when the old settlement at the source of the Volkhov was called Rurik Gorodische in the writings of Novgorod historians. These were the first attempts to connect the history of this place with the legend about Novgorod residents calling Prince Rurik \"from the sea\" in 862. He started the ruling Russian Rurik dynasty which ended with Fyodor Ivanovich, son of Ivan the Terrible, in the 16th century.\nScientific and archaeological researches of recent decades suggest that this settlement was the \"old city\" in relation to the new city–Novgorod arisen downstream Volkhov only in the middle of the 10th century.\nThe Church of the Annunciation built in 1103 by Prince Mstislav was the oldest stone church in Novgorod after the St. Sophia Cathedral. The church was demolished in 1342 to be replaced with a new church. Its remains have survived till nowadays.

The church belongs to the \"towering\" type which appeared in Polotsk and was developed in Smolensk architecture. Construction of the church was started by Smolensk masters, but most works were done by Novgorod architects. The church was reconstructed several times and acquired its contemporary look as a result of the restoration in the 60's of the 20th century.";
